# KernelNftProtocolNetworkNext

## Description

A smart contract suite implementing ERC-721 NFTs with on-chain SVG generation and dynamic metadata updates via a deterministic, verifiable random function seeded by block hashes.

## Features

- Utilizes a Merkle tree structure for efficient NFT ownership verification on-chain.
- Integrates a decentralized storage solution, such as IPFS or Arweave, for persistent NFT metadata storage.
- Implements a gas-optimized lazy minting process using off-chain signatures and on-chain verification.
- Enables fractionalized NFT ownership through ERC-20 token representation, allowing for shared governance and profit sharing.
- Provides a cross-chain NFT bridge supporting seamless transfer of NFTs between different blockchains via atomic swaps.
- Leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-SNARKs) for privacy-preserving NFT transactions and ownership verification.
- Integrates with decentralized identity (DID) solutions for verifiable NFT ownership linked to user credentials.
- Supports dynamic NFT metadata updates triggered by real-world events through oracle integration.
